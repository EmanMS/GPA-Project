## Database Connectivity:
The GPA calculator project is connected to the database using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity). JDBC is a Java API that allows Java programs to access databases. JDBC provides a set of classes and interfaces that enable communication between Java applications and databases.
A JDBC program comprises the following FIVE steps:
STEP 1: Allocate a Connection object, for connecting to the database server.
STEP 2: Allocate a Statement object, under the Connection created earlier, for holding a SQL command.
STEP 3: Write a SQL query and execute the query, via the Statement and Connection created.
STEP 4: Process the query result.
STEP 5: Close the Statement and Connection to free up the resources.
